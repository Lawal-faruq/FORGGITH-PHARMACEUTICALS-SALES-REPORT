# FORGGITH-PHARMACEUTICALS-SALES-REPORT

Forggith Pharmaceuticals, a fictional pharmaceutical manufacturing company based in Germany, is at the forefront of producing life-saving medical drugs. Their commitment to delivering high-quality pharmaceuticals is matched only by their dedication to strategic decision-making.

As a Power BI developer, I was entrusted with the task of crafting comprehensive Power BI reports that not only illuminate the current state of the company's operations but also serve as indispensable tools in shaping effective strategies and tactics. It's essential to note that the data utilized in these reports is entirely fictional, providing a simulated yet insightful representation of what Forggith Pharmaceuticals could extract from their actual operations.

This document outlines the key insights that Forggith Pharmaceuticals seeks to derive from this simulated data through the Power BI reports.

# **Project Methodology**
Understanding the Dataset:

In undertaking this Power BI project for Forggith Pharmaceuticals, I adhered to a systematic methodology aimed at solving real-life data analysis challenges. The initial phase involved a comprehensive exploration of the dataset, wherein I meticulously deciphered the meaning of each column. This process culminated in the creation of a detailed data dictionary, providing a foundational understanding of the dataset's intricacies. The data dictionary image is shown below:

# **Dashboard Design Blueprint** 

Having meticulously grasped the nuances of the dataset, traversing from the fact table to dimension tables, the next pivotal step in the project was to conceptualize the final dashboard. Armed with insights derived from the data, I translated ideas into a tangible form by crafting a detailed template. This process involved the humble yet effective tools of pen and paper, allowing for a visual representation that served as the guiding blueprint for the forthcoming Power BI dashboard.

# **Data Cleaning and Transformation**
With the dataset thoroughly understood and the dashboard design envisioned, the subsequent focus shifted to ensuring the data's integrity and relevance. Leveraging Power Query, I meticulously executed data cleaning and transformation processes, mitigating the risk of errors in subsequent stages.

A pivotal facet of the transformation centered on the Target table, a linchpin in our analysis. The current state of the Target data, as illustrated below, posed challenges to the depth of our insights. Consequently, strategic transformations were applied to elevate the data's quality, setting the stage for robust analysis and informed decision-making.

Let's describe the first transformation step:

**Unpivoting for Enhanced Readability:**

The initial stride in refining the Target table involved a crucial transformation: unpivoting the year columns. This strategic move was instrumental in reshaping the data, fostering a more streamlined and accessible format. The resulting configuration not only enhances readability but also lays the groundwork for more dynamic and insightful analyses.

**Creating Date Columns:**

The journey to refine the Target table continued with a pivotal stepâ€”merging the month and year columns. This harmonious union resulted in the creation of a cohesive date column, lending temporal context to the dataset. Such a transformation not only enhances the structure of the data but also opens avenues for time-based analyses, enriching the depth of insights derived from the Power BI reports.

**Refining Datatypes:**

In the concluding phase of Target table transformation, meticulous attention was devoted to refining datatypes. Specifically, the month column underwent a transformation, transitioning into a date datatype. This final adjustment not only ensures data consistency but also aligns with the standardized format conducive to seamless integration within the Power BI framework.

# **Data Modeling:**

With the data now cleansed and transformed to its optimal state, the focus seamlessly transitions to the vital stage of data modeling. This phase involves the meticulous structuring of both fact and dimension tables, laying the foundation for a robust analytical framework.

The fact tables, brimming with essential transactional data, are intricately modeled to capture nuanced relationships and dependencies. Simultaneously, dimension tables, housing key descriptors, are shaped to provide context and granularity to the analysis.

This intricate interplay between fact and dimension tables serves as the bedrock upon which subsequent analyses and the final Power BI dashboard are constructed.
