# FORGGITH-PHARMACEUTICALS-SALES-REPORT

Forggith Pharmaceuticals, a fictional pharmaceutical manufacturing company based in Germany, is at the forefront of producing life-saving medical drugs. Their commitment to delivering high-quality pharmaceuticals is matched only by their dedication to strategic decision-making.

As a Power BI developer, I was entrusted with the task of crafting comprehensive Power BI reports that not only illuminate the current state of the company's operations but also serve as indispensable tools in shaping effective strategies and tactics. It's essential to note that the data utilized in these reports is entirely fictional, providing a simulated yet insightful representation of what Forggith Pharmaceuticals could extract from their actual operations.

This document outlines the key insights that Forggith Pharmaceuticals seeks to derive from this simulated data through the Power BI reports.
